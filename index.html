   <p>Pugs are a popular, ancient toy breed recognized for their charming, affectionate, and playful temperament, often described by the Latin phrase "multum in parvo"—meaning "a lot in a little". Originating in China around 400 B.C. as treasured companions for emperors, these "velcro" dogs are known for their distinct, wrinkled faces, large, dark eyes, and tightly curled tails. While they are generally low-maintenance in terms of exercise, requiring only moderate activity, they are prone to obesity and require careful dietary management. Their short, smooth coat sheds frequently, and their facial folds need regular cleaning to prevent infection. As a brachycephalic (flat-faced) breed, pugs are susceptible to breathing issues and do not tolerate high heat or humidity well, often preferring to spend their days as indoor companions. Despite these health considerations, their loyal, comical, and gentle nature makes them ideal pets for families, children, and apartment living. </p>
